Welcome to the Course!

Hi Everyone!



Thank you so much for enrolling! I just wanted to personally welcome you to the course, 
I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to teach you about a set of topics I really love, 
data science and machine learning!

This first section really just deals with getting set-up with Anaconda, Python, Jupyter Notebooks etc... 
If you already know about all this stuff (maybe from one of my other courses), you may find it easy to 2x speed 
the videos or maybe even skip around.

Here is some information (that you may have also received in a message/email upon 
enrolling so sorry if its duplicate info!):
