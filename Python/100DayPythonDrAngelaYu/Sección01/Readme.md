Transcripción:

    Hello, and welcome to the world's best Python boot camp.
    My name is Angela.
    I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the AppBerry, London's highest rated programming
    boot camp.
    To date, I've taught over half a million students in person and online, and I'm so excited to
    be your instructor on this course.
    As a student on this course, you're going to get access to over 56 hours of HD video content,
    which contains step-by-step tutorials, interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and more.
    The course is structured around the 100 days of code challenge.
    So you can look forward to 100 days of lovingly crafted content that is going to cover every
    aspect of Python programming, from web development to data science.
    It's the only course you need to become a professional Python developer.
    Every day on the course, you're going to use what you've learned to build a new project.
    You'll build a bot that texts you in the morning if it will rain that day,
    so you never forget your umbrella again.
    You'll build classic arcade games like Snake and Pong to impress your friends by challenging
    them to a game that you built.
    You'll learn to make sense of complex data and create beautiful visualizations
    to impress your colleagues at work.
    You'll create a program that automatically sends happy birthday emails to your friends and family.
    Never forget mom's birthday again.
    You'll work on projects that clone real-world startups.
    Cheap flight club, check.
    Build your own blog, check.
    Twitter bot, check.
    And there are so many more projects waiting to be discovered by you.
    100 projects in total.
    So if you're somebody who wants to get a job as a Python developer,
    then this is perfect for building up your portfolio to show off at your next interview.
    Now this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.
    So if you're somebody who's never coded before,
    I'll be with you every step of the way as I take you from programming fundamentals
    through to more intermediate and advanced programming concepts.
    You're going to learn Python from scratch.
    Now if you're an advanced developer on the other hand,
    then take a look at the curriculum and start at the level that suits you best.
    From beginner to professional, every level is covered in the course.
    Got school?
    Working a full-time job?
    Have to look after kids?
    I know you're busy.
    I've timed each day of the course to take less than two hours to complete
    so you can fit the course around your life.
    This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.
    So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work,
    you'll get access to exactly the same curriculum with years of design and testing behind it
    to ensure that you don't just know what to do but also why you're doing it.
    Now don't just take my word for it.
    Check out what my past students had to say about my courses.
    So what are you still waiting for?
    Find out why over half a million students have rated my course five stars
    and see what you can do by mastering Python.
