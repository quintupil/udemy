00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Hello, and welcome to the world's best Python boot camp.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.600
My name is Angela.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.680
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the AppBerry, London's highest rated programming

00:15.680 --> 00:16.680
boot camp.

00:16.680 --> 00:23.600
To date, I've taught over half a million students in person and online, and I'm so excited to

00:23.600 --> 00:25.840
be your instructor on this course.

00:26.080 --> 00:32.640
As a student on this course, you're going to get access to over 56 hours of HD video content,

00:32.640 --> 00:38.480
which contains step-by-step tutorials, interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and more.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.480
The course is structured around the 100 days of code challenge.

00:43.120 --> 00:49.920
So you can look forward to 100 days of lovingly crafted content that is going to cover every

00:49.920 --> 00:54.320
aspect of Python programming, from web development to data science.

00:54.880 --> 00:59.600
It's the only course you need to become a professional Python developer.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.560
Every day on the course, you're going to use what you've learned to build a new project.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.200
You'll build a bot that texts you in the morning if it will rain that day,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.600
so you never forget your umbrella again.

01:11.600 --> 01:17.680
You'll build classic arcade games like Snake and Pong to impress your friends by challenging

01:17.680 --> 01:19.440
them to a game that you built.

01:20.320 --> 01:24.960
You'll learn to make sense of complex data and create beautiful visualizations

01:24.960 --> 01:26.720
to impress your colleagues at work.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.960
You'll create a program that automatically sends happy birthday emails to your friends and family.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.600
Never forget mom's birthday again.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.040
You'll work on projects that clone real-world startups.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.800
Cheap flight club, check.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.560
Build your own blog, check.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.760
Twitter bot, check.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.160
And there are so many more projects waiting to be discovered by you.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.720
100 projects in total.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.200
So if you're somebody who wants to get a job as a Python developer,

01:55.200 --> 02:00.000
then this is perfect for building up your portfolio to show off at your next interview.

02:00.800 --> 02:05.680
Now this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.280
So if you're somebody who's never coded before,

02:09.280 --> 02:14.800
I'll be with you every step of the way as I take you from programming fundamentals

02:14.800 --> 02:18.240
through to more intermediate and advanced programming concepts.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.520
You're going to learn Python from scratch.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.160
Now if you're an advanced developer on the other hand,

02:24.160 --> 02:28.400
then take a look at the curriculum and start at the level that suits you best.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.120
From beginner to professional, every level is covered in the course.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.640
Got school?

02:34.640 --> 02:36.320
Working a full-time job?

02:36.320 --> 02:37.920
Have to look after kids?

02:37.920 --> 02:39.360
I know you're busy.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.000
I've timed each day of the course to take less than two hours to complete

02:44.000 --> 02:46.720
so you can fit the course around your life.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.480
This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.240
So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work,

02:56.240 --> 03:01.920
you'll get access to exactly the same curriculum with years of design and testing behind it

03:01.920 --> 03:06.480
to ensure that you don't just know what to do but also why you're doing it.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.720
Now don't just take my word for it.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.680
Check out what my past students had to say about my courses.

03:14.640 --> 03:19.680
So what are you still waiting for?

03:19.680 --> 03:24.480
Find out why over half a million students have rated my course five stars

03:24.480 --> 03:27.680
and see what you can do by mastering Python.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.640
Hi.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.240
This is where you start the course.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.840
But first, I want to tell you a little bit about it

03:52.640 --> 03:54.880
because this is more than a course.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.400
It's a journey.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.240
And it's a challenge.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.720
A challenge to yourself.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.120
I often hear people say,

04:03.120 --> 04:04.320
I want to learn to code.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.000
I want to become an app developer.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.360
I want a new job.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.400
I want to build my app.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.400
But without action, those words are meaningless.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.040
But you are different.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.160
I know it.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.120
Even though I don't know you personally,

04:19.120 --> 04:22.560
I know you purchased this course and you haven't left it at that.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.160
You've made a start.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.680
And success comes to those who show up.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.880
And you showed up today.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.200
I know you can do this.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.600
You can make your dreams come true.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.520
You can change your own future.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.920
And you can change the lives of those people around you.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.920
One of the questions I hear most often is,

04:41.920 --> 04:43.600
what's the best way to learn to code?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.840
Well, here it is.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.920
It's the 100 days of code challenge.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.520
Code for at least an hour over 100 days.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.200
You're practicing a muscle to get strong at coding.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.800
Then the next question, inevitably, is,

04:59.520 --> 05:01.360
well, what do I do each day?

05:02.320 --> 05:04.960
And I've spent years thinking about this question.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.600
And finally, I'm now able to definitively answer that.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.360
It's this course.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.520
Every day, you're going to learn and apply new programming concepts.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.280
After 100 days of repeating this process,

05:21.280 --> 05:26.080
not only will you have covered the entire professional Python curriculum,

05:26.080 --> 05:29.200
you'll also be so good that they can't ignore you.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.440
There are just two rules to get the most out of this course.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.480
One, pledge to code for an hour a day for 100 days.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.520
To keep yourself accountable, I recommend downloading the course pledge.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.520
This is a contract with yourself.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.960
You can print it out and pin it somewhere you can always see.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.240
For example, above your computer or on your desk.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.640
By signing the pledge, you're making a commitment to yourself.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.720
It's only for you.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.160
No one else needs to see it.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.640
You can download the pledge in the course resources for this lesson.

06:05.760 --> 06:12.160
The second rule is to log your progress using the 100 days of code hashtag on Twitter.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.400
There are millions of other students who are on this journey with you,

06:16.400 --> 06:18.720
and they will support you when times get tough.

06:19.520 --> 06:24.880
I recommend tweeting your progress each day with the hashtag 100 days of code

06:24.880 --> 06:28.480
and search the hashtag on Twitter to see what others are doing

06:28.560 --> 06:30.160
as a part of their 100 days.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.040
And that's all there is to it.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.280
So here's to your success and let's get started with the course.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.480
Hey guys, it's Angela here.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.120
After I made this course, I decided to take it myself

06:51.120 --> 06:54.000
so I could see what it's like to be in your shoes.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.880
Along the way, I realized there are things we could create

06:58.880 --> 07:03.360
to make your learning experience easier and even more enjoyable.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.520
So in this video, I'm going to share my top tips

07:07.520 --> 07:11.360
and how to use all the tools and resources we built for you.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.720
The first tip I have for you is to use another screen.

07:17.600 --> 07:23.600
That way, you can watch the lesson on a tablet or phone and code on your main computer.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.680
So you can code along with me and get practice

07:27.680 --> 07:29.680
instead of just listening to the videos.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.560
Programming is a practical skill.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.320
So just as you need practice when learning skateboarding,

07:36.880 --> 07:40.000
you also need practice to get good at programming.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.480
Tip number two.

07:42.480 --> 07:47.440
I created a Python syntax cheat sheet which you can download and print out.

07:48.080 --> 07:52.320
It contains some of the most common programming concepts we'll learn

07:52.320 --> 07:56.320
and it's a handy reference to have when you're doing the coding challenges.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.720
You can download this in the course resources for this lesson

08:01.440 --> 08:05.440
where you'll also find my 12 rules to learn to code ebook.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.640
One of the hardest things about learning is keeping the motivation high.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.320
I find I'm usually more motivated when I'm in the library or a cafe

08:16.320 --> 08:19.360
where I can see other people studying or working hard.

08:20.160 --> 08:26.160
So I decided to create a two-hour study with me video where I'm concentrating hard.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.520
We'll work for 25 minutes at a time

08:29.520 --> 08:33.600
and then take a five-minute break before we get back to the next pomodoro.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.680
Tip number four.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.360
When you're learning new programming concepts,

08:39.360 --> 08:44.960
it's a good idea to note down how the code works while your mind is fresh on that topic.

08:45.840 --> 08:52.880
So I created a coding notes page that you can print out and collate to create a coding notebook.

08:53.840 --> 09:00.480
The note paper is the perfect place to write down examples of coding concepts you've learned.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.600
It comes with line numbers and handy indentation guides

09:05.600 --> 09:09.920
which is super useful when it comes to writing out Python code.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.880
Coding is not like history.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.440
There's nothing you need to memorize.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.760
It's a bit like baking.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.080
You don't need to remember the recipe.

09:20.080 --> 09:24.480
You just need to get practice and understand how to use the recipe.

09:25.120 --> 09:31.040
One of the most helpful note-taking systems for learning is the Cornell note method.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.200
In our coding notebook, we've incorporated all the key elements from Cornell,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.720
including the sidebar where you can write comments on each line of code

09:43.360 --> 09:49.120
and the bottom summary section where you can write an overview of the concept you just learned.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.720
In the course resources for this lesson,

09:52.720 --> 09:57.040
you'll also find some desktop wallpapers I've created for you.

09:57.840 --> 10:03.120
They contain some of the messages I keep around my desk to keep me motivated

10:03.120 --> 10:04.800
and I hope they'll help you too.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.440
Tip number five.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.880
Celebrate after you complete each day.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.920
Because this course is designed to take you from beginner to professional,

10:16.480 --> 10:22.080
as you go from day to day, there will be less and less tutorial and more and more practice.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.360
To keep you on track, I've created a hundred days of code poster.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.680
Once you complete a day, you can check it off on the poster.

10:31.680 --> 10:36.400
So print it out, put it up on a wall and take each day as a challenge.

10:37.120 --> 10:43.760
Reward yourself after each day you tick off and day by day you'll learn and grow as a developer.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.520
This course is a safe space where you can make mistakes, ask questions,

10:50.080 --> 10:55.040
but most importantly, become confident in your skills as a programmer.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.720
I had so much fun building this course

10:59.280 --> 11:02.400
and I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

11:03.200 --> 11:08.400
So here's to your success.
