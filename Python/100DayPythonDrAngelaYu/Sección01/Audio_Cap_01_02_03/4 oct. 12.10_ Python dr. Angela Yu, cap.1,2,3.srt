1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello, and welcome to the world's best Python boot camp.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,600
My name is Angela.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,680
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the AppBerry, London's highest rated programming

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
boot camp.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,600
To date, I've taught over half a million students in person and online, and I'm so excited to

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
be your instructor on this course.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,640
As a student on this course, you're going to get access to over 56 hours of HD video content,

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,480
which contains step-by-step tutorials, interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and more.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,480
The course is structured around the 100 days of code challenge.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,920
So you can look forward to 100 days of lovingly crafted content that is going to cover every

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
aspect of Python programming, from web development to data science.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,600
It's the only course you need to become a professional Python developer.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,560
Every day on the course, you're going to use what you've learned to build a new project.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,200
You'll build a bot that texts you in the morning if it will rain that day,

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,600
so you never forget your umbrella again.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,680
You'll build classic arcade games like Snake and Pong to impress your friends by challenging

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,440
them to a game that you built.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,960
You'll learn to make sense of complex data and create beautiful visualizations

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
to impress your colleagues at work.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,960
You'll create a program that automatically sends happy birthday emails to your friends and family.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
Never forget mom's birthday again.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
You'll work on projects that clone real-world startups.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,800
Cheap flight club, check.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,560
Build your own blog, check.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,760
Twitter bot, check.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,160
And there are so many more projects waiting to be discovered by you.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,720
100 projects in total.

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
So if you're somebody who wants to get a job as a Python developer,

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
then this is perfect for building up your portfolio to show off at your next interview.

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,680
Now this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,280
So if you're somebody who's never coded before,

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,800
I'll be with you every step of the way as I take you from programming fundamentals

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,240
through to more intermediate and advanced programming concepts.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,520
You're going to learn Python from scratch.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
Now if you're an advanced developer on the other hand,

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,400
then take a look at the curriculum and start at the level that suits you best.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,120
From beginner to professional, every level is covered in the course.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
Got school?

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,320
Working a full-time job?

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,920
Have to look after kids?

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
I know you're busy.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
I've timed each day of the course to take less than two hours to complete

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
so you can fit the course around your life.

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,480
This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,240
So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work,

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,920
you'll get access to exactly the same curriculum with years of design and testing behind it

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,480
to ensure that you don't just know what to do but also why you're doing it.

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720
Now don't just take my word for it.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,680
Check out what my past students had to say about my courses.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,680
So what are you still waiting for?

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,480
Find out why over half a million students have rated my course five stars

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
and see what you can do by mastering Python.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
Hi.

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,240
This is where you start the course.

55
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
But first, I want to tell you a little bit about it

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,880
because this is more than a course.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
It's a journey.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
And it's a challenge.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
A challenge to yourself.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,120
I often hear people say,

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
I want to learn to code.

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,000
I want to become an app developer.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
I want a new job.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
I want to build my app.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
But without action, those words are meaningless.

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
But you are different.

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,160
I know it.

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
Even though I don't know you personally,

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
I know you purchased this course and you haven't left it at that.

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
You've made a start.

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
And success comes to those who show up.

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,880
And you showed up today.

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,200
I know you can do this.

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
You can make your dreams come true.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
You can change your own future.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,920
And you can change the lives of those people around you.

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,920
One of the questions I hear most often is,

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
what's the best way to learn to code?

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
Well, here it is.

80
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,920
It's the 100 days of code challenge.

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,520
Code for at least an hour over 100 days.

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,200
You're practicing a muscle to get strong at coding.

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Then the next question, inevitably, is,

84
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
well, what do I do each day?

85
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,960
And I've spent years thinking about this question.

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,600
And finally, I'm now able to definitively answer that.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,360
It's this course.

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Every day, you're going to learn and apply new programming concepts.

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,280
After 100 days of repeating this process,

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,080
not only will you have covered the entire professional Python curriculum,

91
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,200
you'll also be so good that they can't ignore you.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
There are just two rules to get the most out of this course.

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,480
One, pledge to code for an hour a day for 100 days.

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
To keep yourself accountable, I recommend downloading the course pledge.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
This is a contract with yourself.

96
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,960
You can print it out and pin it somewhere you can always see.

97
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
For example, above your computer or on your desk.

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,640
By signing the pledge, you're making a commitment to yourself.

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,720
It's only for you.

100
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
No one else needs to see it.

101
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,640
You can download the pledge in the course resources for this lesson.

102
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,160
The second rule is to log your progress using the 100 days of code hashtag on Twitter.

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,400
There are millions of other students who are on this journey with you,

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
and they will support you when times get tough.

105
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,880
I recommend tweeting your progress each day with the hashtag 100 days of code

106
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,480
and search the hashtag on Twitter to see what others are doing

107
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,160
as a part of their 100 days.

108
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
And that's all there is to it.

109
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,280
So here's to your success and let's get started with the course.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,480
Hey guys, it's Angela here.

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120
After I made this course, I decided to take it myself

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
so I could see what it's like to be in your shoes.

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,880
Along the way, I realized there are things we could create

114
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,360
to make your learning experience easier and even more enjoyable.

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
So in this video, I'm going to share my top tips

116
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,360
and how to use all the tools and resources we built for you.

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,720
The first tip I have for you is to use another screen.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,600
That way, you can watch the lesson on a tablet or phone and code on your main computer.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
So you can code along with me and get practice

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
instead of just listening to the videos.

121
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Programming is a practical skill.

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,320
So just as you need practice when learning skateboarding,

123
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
you also need practice to get good at programming.

124
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
Tip number two.

125
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,440
I created a Python syntax cheat sheet which you can download and print out.

126
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,320
It contains some of the most common programming concepts we'll learn

127
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,320
and it's a handy reference to have when you're doing the coding challenges.

128
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,720
You can download this in the course resources for this lesson

129
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
where you'll also find my 12 rules to learn to code ebook.

130
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,640
One of the hardest things about learning is keeping the motivation high.

131
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,320
I find I'm usually more motivated when I'm in the library or a cafe

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,360
where I can see other people studying or working hard.

133
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,160
So I decided to create a two-hour study with me video where I'm concentrating hard.

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,520
We'll work for 25 minutes at a time

135
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,600
and then take a five-minute break before we get back to the next pomodoro.

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,680
Tip number four.

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,360
When you're learning new programming concepts,

138
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,960
it's a good idea to note down how the code works while your mind is fresh on that topic.

139
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,880
So I created a coding notes page that you can print out and collate to create a coding notebook.

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,480
The note paper is the perfect place to write down examples of coding concepts you've learned.

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,600
It comes with line numbers and handy indentation guides

142
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,920
which is super useful when it comes to writing out Python code.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
Coding is not like history.

144
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,440
There's nothing you need to memorize.

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
It's a bit like baking.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
You don't need to remember the recipe.

147
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,480
You just need to get practice and understand how to use the recipe.

148
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,040
One of the most helpful note-taking systems for learning is the Cornell note method.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,200
In our coding notebook, we've incorporated all the key elements from Cornell,

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,720
including the sidebar where you can write comments on each line of code

151
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,120
and the bottom summary section where you can write an overview of the concept you just learned.

152
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,720
In the course resources for this lesson,

153
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
you'll also find some desktop wallpapers I've created for you.

154
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,120
They contain some of the messages I keep around my desk to keep me motivated

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
and I hope they'll help you too.

156
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
Tip number five.

157
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,880
Celebrate after you complete each day.

158
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,920
Because this course is designed to take you from beginner to professional,

159
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,080
as you go from day to day, there will be less and less tutorial and more and more practice.

160
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,360
To keep you on track, I've created a hundred days of code poster.

161
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
Once you complete a day, you can check it off on the poster.

162
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,400
So print it out, put it up on a wall and take each day as a challenge.

163
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,760
Reward yourself after each day you tick off and day by day you'll learn and grow as a developer.

164
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,520
This course is a safe space where you can make mistakes, ask questions,

165
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,040
but most importantly, become confident in your skills as a programmer.

166
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
I had so much fun building this course

167
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,400
and I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

168
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,400
So here's to your success.
