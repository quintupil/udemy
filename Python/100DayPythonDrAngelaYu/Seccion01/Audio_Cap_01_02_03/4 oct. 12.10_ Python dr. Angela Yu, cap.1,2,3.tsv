0	7920	Hello, and welcome to the world's best Python boot camp.
7920	9600	My name is Angela.
9600	15680	I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the AppBerry, London's highest rated programming
15680	16680	boot camp.
16680	23600	To date, I've taught over half a million students in person and online, and I'm so excited to
23600	25840	be your instructor on this course.
26080	32640	As a student on this course, you're going to get access to over 56 hours of HD video content,
32640	38480	which contains step-by-step tutorials, interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and more.
39120	42480	The course is structured around the 100 days of code challenge.
43120	49920	So you can look forward to 100 days of lovingly crafted content that is going to cover every
49920	54320	aspect of Python programming, from web development to data science.
54880	59600	It's the only course you need to become a professional Python developer.
60160	64560	Every day on the course, you're going to use what you've learned to build a new project.
65360	69200	You'll build a bot that texts you in the morning if it will rain that day,
69200	71600	so you never forget your umbrella again.
71600	77680	You'll build classic arcade games like Snake and Pong to impress your friends by challenging
77680	79440	them to a game that you built.
80320	84960	You'll learn to make sense of complex data and create beautiful visualizations
84960	86720	to impress your colleagues at work.
87760	92960	You'll create a program that automatically sends happy birthday emails to your friends and family.
93520	95600	Never forget mom's birthday again.
95600	99040	You'll work on projects that clone real-world startups.
99040	100800	Cheap flight club, check.
100800	102560	Build your own blog, check.
102560	103760	Twitter bot, check.
104400	108160	And there are so many more projects waiting to be discovered by you.
108800	110720	100 projects in total.
111600	115200	So if you're somebody who wants to get a job as a Python developer,
115200	120000	then this is perfect for building up your portfolio to show off at your next interview.
120800	125680	Now this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.
126400	129280	So if you're somebody who's never coded before,
129280	134800	I'll be with you every step of the way as I take you from programming fundamentals
134800	138240	through to more intermediate and advanced programming concepts.
138880	141520	You're going to learn Python from scratch.
141520	144160	Now if you're an advanced developer on the other hand,
144160	148400	then take a look at the curriculum and start at the level that suits you best.
148960	153120	From beginner to professional, every level is covered in the course.
153680	154640	Got school?
154640	156320	Working a full-time job?
156320	157920	Have to look after kids?
157920	159360	I know you're busy.
159360	164000	I've timed each day of the course to take less than two hours to complete
164000	166720	so you can fit the course around your life.
166720	172480	This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.
172480	176240	So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work,
176240	181920	you'll get access to exactly the same curriculum with years of design and testing behind it
181920	186480	to ensure that you don't just know what to do but also why you're doing it.
186480	188720	Now don't just take my word for it.
188720	191680	Check out what my past students had to say about my courses.
194640	199680	So what are you still waiting for?
199680	204480	Find out why over half a million students have rated my course five stars
204480	207680	and see what you can do by mastering Python.
224400	226640	Hi.
226640	228240	This is where you start the course.
229040	231840	But first, I want to tell you a little bit about it
232640	234880	because this is more than a course.
235520	236400	It's a journey.
237280	238240	And it's a challenge.
239200	240720	A challenge to yourself.
241600	243120	I often hear people say,
243120	244320	I want to learn to code.
244320	246000	I want to become an app developer.
246000	247360	I want a new job.
247360	248400	I want to build my app.
249120	252400	But without action, those words are meaningless.
253360	255040	But you are different.
255520	256160	I know it.
257040	259120	Even though I don't know you personally,
259120	262560	I know you purchased this course and you haven't left it at that.
263200	264160	You've made a start.
264720	267680	And success comes to those who show up.
267680	268880	And you showed up today.
269840	271200	I know you can do this.
271840	273600	You can make your dreams come true.
273600	275520	You can change your own future.
275520	277920	And you can change the lives of those people around you.
278880	281920	One of the questions I hear most often is,
281920	283600	what's the best way to learn to code?
284400	285840	Well, here it is.
285840	287920	It's the 100 days of code challenge.
288640	291520	Code for at least an hour over 100 days.
292320	295200	You're practicing a muscle to get strong at coding.
296240	298800	Then the next question, inevitably, is,
299520	301360	well, what do I do each day?
302320	304960	And I've spent years thinking about this question.
305760	309600	And finally, I'm now able to definitively answer that.
310480	311360	It's this course.
313520	317520	Every day, you're going to learn and apply new programming concepts.
318480	321280	After 100 days of repeating this process,
321280	326080	not only will you have covered the entire professional Python curriculum,
326080	329200	you'll also be so good that they can't ignore you.
330400	333440	There are just two rules to get the most out of this course.
334400	338480	One, pledge to code for an hour a day for 100 days.
339600	343520	To keep yourself accountable, I recommend downloading the course pledge.
343520	345520	This is a contract with yourself.
346080	348960	You can print it out and pin it somewhere you can always see.
349520	352240	For example, above your computer or on your desk.
353200	356640	By signing the pledge, you're making a commitment to yourself.
357200	358720	It's only for you.
358720	360160	No one else needs to see it.
361120	364640	You can download the pledge in the course resources for this lesson.
365760	372160	The second rule is to log your progress using the 100 days of code hashtag on Twitter.
373040	376400	There are millions of other students who are on this journey with you,
376400	378720	and they will support you when times get tough.
379520	384880	I recommend tweeting your progress each day with the hashtag 100 days of code
384880	388480	and search the hashtag on Twitter to see what others are doing
388560	390160	as a part of their 100 days.
391120	393040	And that's all there is to it.
393040	397280	So here's to your success and let's get started with the course.
404000	406480	Hey guys, it's Angela here.
407440	411120	After I made this course, I decided to take it myself
411120	414000	so I could see what it's like to be in your shoes.
414960	418880	Along the way, I realized there are things we could create
418880	423360	to make your learning experience easier and even more enjoyable.
424160	427520	So in this video, I'm going to share my top tips
427520	431360	and how to use all the tools and resources we built for you.
433200	436720	The first tip I have for you is to use another screen.
437600	443600	That way, you can watch the lesson on a tablet or phone and code on your main computer.
444160	447680	So you can code along with me and get practice
447680	449680	instead of just listening to the videos.
450480	452560	Programming is a practical skill.
452560	456320	So just as you need practice when learning skateboarding,
456880	460000	you also need practice to get good at programming.
461120	462480	Tip number two.
462480	467440	I created a Python syntax cheat sheet which you can download and print out.
468080	472320	It contains some of the most common programming concepts we'll learn
472320	476320	and it's a handy reference to have when you're doing the coding challenges.
477040	480720	You can download this in the course resources for this lesson
481440	485440	where you'll also find my 12 rules to learn to code ebook.
486400	490640	One of the hardest things about learning is keeping the motivation high.
491440	496320	I find I'm usually more motivated when I'm in the library or a cafe
496320	499360	where I can see other people studying or working hard.
500160	506160	So I decided to create a two-hour study with me video where I'm concentrating hard.
506880	509520	We'll work for 25 minutes at a time
509520	513600	and then take a five-minute break before we get back to the next pomodoro.
514480	515680	Tip number four.
516480	519360	When you're learning new programming concepts,
519360	524960	it's a good idea to note down how the code works while your mind is fresh on that topic.
525840	532880	So I created a coding notes page that you can print out and collate to create a coding notebook.
533840	540480	The note paper is the perfect place to write down examples of coding concepts you've learned.
541200	545600	It comes with line numbers and handy indentation guides
545600	549920	which is super useful when it comes to writing out Python code.
550720	552880	Coding is not like history.
553520	555440	There's nothing you need to memorize.
556080	557760	It's a bit like baking.
557760	560080	You don't need to remember the recipe.
560080	564480	You just need to get practice and understand how to use the recipe.
565120	571040	One of the most helpful note-taking systems for learning is the Cornell note method.
572000	577200	In our coding notebook, we've incorporated all the key elements from Cornell,
578000	582720	including the sidebar where you can write comments on each line of code
583360	589120	and the bottom summary section where you can write an overview of the concept you just learned.
590160	592720	In the course resources for this lesson,
592720	597040	you'll also find some desktop wallpapers I've created for you.
597840	603120	They contain some of the messages I keep around my desk to keep me motivated
603120	604800	and I hope they'll help you too.
604800	607440	Tip number five.
608400	610880	Celebrate after you complete each day.
611680	615920	Because this course is designed to take you from beginner to professional,
616480	622080	as you go from day to day, there will be less and less tutorial and more and more practice.
622880	627360	To keep you on track, I've created a hundred days of code poster.
628240	631680	Once you complete a day, you can check it off on the poster.
631680	636400	So print it out, put it up on a wall and take each day as a challenge.
637120	643760	Reward yourself after each day you tick off and day by day you'll learn and grow as a developer.
644960	649520	This course is a safe space where you can make mistakes, ask questions,
650080	655040	but most importantly, become confident in your skills as a programmer.
656320	658720	I had so much fun building this course
659280	662400	and I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
663200	668400	So here's to your success.
