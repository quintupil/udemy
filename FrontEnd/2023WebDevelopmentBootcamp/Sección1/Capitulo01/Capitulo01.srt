00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,120
Hello, and welcome to the world's best web development course.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
My name is Angela.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,440
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's highest

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,440
rated programming boot camp.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,560
To date, I've taught over a million students worldwide, in person and online.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,120
And today I'm so excited that I have the privilege to be your instructor on this course.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:40,520
You're going to get access to over 55 hours of HD video content, step-by-step tutorials,

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,400
interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and much, much more.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,680
This course is created with the same curriculum as our 12-week in-person programming boot camp.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,440
So that means you can look forwards to the same professional level content, covering

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,360
every aspect of web development from HTML to React.

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,840
This is the only course you need to become a professional full-stack web developer.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,400
And the best part?

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,320
The course is completely project-based.

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,160
So that means you're going to learn everything you need to know while building beautiful

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,760
real-world websites and web applications.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,520
You'll build a beautiful product website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
You'll build games and musical apps like the StrongKit.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
You'll learn about Node, React, and the MearnStack to build classic developer projects like a

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,280
to-do list app and a project manager that's perfect for showing off at your next interview.

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,200
If you're curious, take a look at the downloadable curriculum to learn more.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,600
Now this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,800
So if you're a complete beginner, I'll be there every step of the way, taking you from

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,680
programming fundamentals all the way through to intermediate and more advanced concepts.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,320
Now if you're an advanced developer, then take a look at the curriculum and start at

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,280
the level that suits you best.

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,480
So instead of spending $12,000 on our in-person bootcamp and having to take time off work,

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,920
you're going to get access to exactly the same curriculum that has years of design and

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,400
testing behind it.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,680
So you won't just know what to do, but also why you're doing it.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
Now don't just take my word for it.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,080
