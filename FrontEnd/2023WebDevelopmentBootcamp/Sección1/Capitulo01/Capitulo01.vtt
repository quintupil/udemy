Hello, and welcome to the world's best web development course.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.120
My name is Angela.

00:11.120 --> 00:17.440
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's highest

00:17.440 --> 00:19.440
rated programming boot camp.

00:19.440 --> 00:25.560
To date, I've taught over a million students worldwide, in person and online.

00:26.560 --> 00:32.120
And today I'm so excited that I have the privilege to be your instructor on this course.

00:32.120 --> 00:40.520
You're going to get access to over 55 hours of HD video content, step-by-step tutorials,

00:40.520 --> 00:45.400
interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and much, much more.

00:45.400 --> 00:52.680
This course is created with the same curriculum as our 12-week in-person programming boot camp.

00:52.680 --> 00:58.440
So that means you can look forwards to the same professional level content, covering

00:58.440 --> 01:03.360
every aspect of web development from HTML to React.

01:03.360 --> 01:10.840
This is the only course you need to become a professional full-stack web developer.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.400
And the best part?

01:12.400 --> 01:15.320
The course is completely project-based.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.160
So that means you're going to learn everything you need to know while building beautiful

01:20.160 --> 01:23.760
real-world websites and web applications.

01:23.760 --> 01:29.520
You'll build a beautiful product website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.200
You'll build games and musical apps like the StrongKit.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.560
You'll learn about Node, React, and the MearnStack to build classic developer projects like a

01:38.560 --> 01:45.280
to-do list app and a project manager that's perfect for showing off at your next interview.

01:45.280 --> 01:50.200
If you're curious, take a look at the downloadable curriculum to learn more.

01:50.200 --> 01:55.600
Now this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.800
So if you're a complete beginner, I'll be there every step of the way, taking you from

02:01.800 --> 02:07.680
programming fundamentals all the way through to intermediate and more advanced concepts.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.320
Now if you're an advanced developer, then take a look at the curriculum and start at

02:12.320 --> 02:14.280
the level that suits you best.

02:14.280 --> 02:21.480
So instead of spending $12,000 on our in-person bootcamp and having to take time off work,

02:21.480 --> 02:26.920
you're going to get access to exactly the same curriculum that has years of design and

02:26.920 --> 02:28.400
testing behind it.

02:28.400 --> 02:33.680
So you won't just know what to do, but also why you're doing it.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.080
Now don't just take my word for it.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.080
Check out what my past students had to say about the course.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.480
Your time is precious.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.480
That's why you deserve the best course money can buy.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.600

02:52.600 --> 02:58.960

02:58.960 --> 03:03.680
